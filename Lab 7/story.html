<h1>Day I realized drawing is a stress buster for me</h1>  
<main>
    <p>We all have experienced stress at some point of our life and how we tackle the situation decides our resiliency.<br>During my undergrads, there was this one subject which was incomprehensible for me. It went to a point where one day
        professor told me that it would greatly affect my overall grades. That was the last stroke to make me tensed. After 
        coming back from college, I just started drawing and without even realising I made a mandala design. When I gave it 
        a final touch I was flabbergasted because making a mandala was one of the task which I thought I'm not capable of 
        till that moment (at the end is the glimpse of my mandala design). This lead me to think that nothing is impossible and I studied really hard for that subject.
        As a reasult I topped the final exam of that subject.<br>From then onwards whenever I feel low I start drawing the designs which I think I'm not capable of and the end result 
        have always filled in positive energy to overcome all the hurdels.
