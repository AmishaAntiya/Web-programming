        <p>Mathematics have always been my favorite class during my high school. One of the reason is I love solving problems and this class used to help me regain my energy after theory classes.</p>
        <aside>Memorable memory: Making the study desk as dinning table, keeping all of our tiffins on it and having lots of options when we don't like our own tiffin :)</aside>
